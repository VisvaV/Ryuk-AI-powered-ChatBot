LangChain is a framework to build applications using LLms

LLMs are stateless first : they don't remember past conversations, no memory, cannot surf the internet like google search
but with LangChain we can make the LLms to use memory, use google search, calculators, etc

prompt template: dynamic prompts
memory: stores chat conversation
chains: connects steps together
agents: lets llm choose what tool to use and when
